**Phases**
Combat can be described by the following phases.

**Initialization**
This phase is unseen by the player for the most part, with the exception of a short countdown timer that is seen at the start of the battle, During this phase the creation of all components involved in the battle takes place, the positioning of the player, loading and syncing of data and so on.

**Battle Phase**
Phase A, is the first battle phase, there are conditions to determine the turn-order, in terms of who can attack and when. Initiation (Attack-Order) for individual members is determined by two main components, That characters Dexterity, and importantly initiation bonuses based on how the battle began. A team who initializes an attack is given a bonus to their initiation stat.

Attacks are not done per team, but rather on a member to member basis determined by the turn order. A member will never be forced to lose a turn due to being "too slow", though it is possible if a member is stunned or under some effect that causes them to lose their turn.

During this phase a member can use any number of attacks, so long as they have the cost for it. Players can choose to end their turn after running out of points or "End & Block" for a cost of one point, placing them into "Block" mode, until there next attack.

**Resolution Phase**
During this phase status effects "tick", applying their effects to all applied members on the field, after this resolution checks are ran to determine if a winner has been decided. It should be noted that this check is ran following each members death as well.

Certain skills or moves may directly reference the resolution phase as part of their cards, such as activating an effect after X resolution phase or during a resolution phase.

**Exit Phase**
The exit phase represents the phase following a winner, rewards are allotted to each players, the battle is deconstructed. Returning the player to the world of spire out of combat mode. Players are also granted a battle immunity for (X)Mins or until they encounter an "Unavoidable" combat or initialize combat themselves.
