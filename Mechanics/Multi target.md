#Multi-Target 

maybe we make it like star rail where the maximum range is 3 for multi hit maybe some type of damage balance for instance
slash with a sword will only hit 2 targets doing 60% to the first enemy then 40% to the second
and a heavy weapon could hit 3 people with slash but it does maybe like 30% 30% 50% so you do more overall damage but also clearly a difference and possibly a major drawback

would make the game more interesting because i could have 2 sword dudes on my team with slash but one is using a heavy weapon and the other a medium weapon. choosing which character will use the move which will use my energy economy will add to the strategy and therefore making the game more entertaining.

maybe we could have some darkest dungeon concepts. for instance in DD if a teammate dies depending on your character you could either get a negative like "terrified" or if you are brave get some type of buff like "still thinking" 

AND MAYBE if we wanted it to be easier we could give the same move to a light weapon and it does 100 or 110% to a single target (not necessary just a thought)

idk how hard any of this would be to program to lmk
