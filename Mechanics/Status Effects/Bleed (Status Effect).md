**Description**:  
Bleed represents an open wound that causes continual loss of health over time. This effect is inflicted by sharp or piercing attacks, especially from light weapons like daggers, claws, or certain abilities. As blood flows from the wound, the victim becomes progressively weaker, making them more vulnerable to further attacks.

**Mechanics**:
- **Damage Over Time**: Bleed causes the affected target to lose **a percentage of their max HP** at the **start of each turn**. This percentage could range from 2-5%, scaling based on the source of the bleed (i.e., stronger abilities may apply a higher bleed damage).
- **Duration**: The **Bleed** effect typically lasts **2-4 turns**, though certain talents or abilities can extend its duration.
- **Stacking**: Bleed can stack multiple times, with each stack increasing the overall damage per turn. However, the effect caps at a certain number of stacks (e.g., 3-5) to prevent it from being too powerful.
  Stacking bleed does not reset it's duration, this can only be done through moves/talents or by reapplying bleed.
  **Removal:** The bleed status effect can be removed by heal abilities, this is a guaranteed change at 1 stack of bleed but as bleed stacks, the change of it being removed on heal is reduced.
  
**Example**:
Player A, applies Bleed to Player B, the duration though not explicitly stated is 2 turns. At the start of player B's turn they take 3% max hp as damage. 
After the bleed effect duration had run out, Player A activates a card that increases bleed damage dealt to players, and lands another attack that applies bleed, Player b now takes 5% max hp as damage per turn.
