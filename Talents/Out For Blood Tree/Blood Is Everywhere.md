req should be have every other out for blood talent


when the entire enemy team is bleeding (enemy team must have at least 2 team members alive) your next move will remove the bleeding effect from whoever you hit and do flat damage based off how long their bleeding was going to last
probably needs like a 5 turn cooldown
