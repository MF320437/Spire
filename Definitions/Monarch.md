In a world shaped by the collective consciousness of its inhabitants, the **Monarchs** reign as living **embodiments of societal concepts and stigmatized authorities**. They are not mere rulers but **manifestations of the collective thoughts, fears, and beliefs** that pervade society. Each Monarch draws their power from the stigma surrounding the authority they embody, growing stronger as these concepts become more feared, revered, or misunderstood.

Origins of Monarchs  
Monarchs were born from the ancient convergence of thought and belief, where the weight of **societal perception** gave life to these powerful entities. Some say they were once mortal rulers who ascended to a higher plane of existence, becoming immortal symbols of the concepts they represented. Others believe they were created by the gods to maintain balance, only to become corrupted by the very powers they were meant to oversee.

Power Dynamics  
The strength of a Monarch is inextricably linked to public perception. The more a society stigmatizes or reveres an authority, the more power the corresponding Monarch accumulates. Monarchs are both protectors and tyrants, maintaining a delicate balance between sustaining their power and avoiding the downfall that comes from a shift in societal views.

- **Public Perception**: A Monarch’s power ebbs and flows with the changing tides of public opinion. If a society fears tyranny, the Tyrant Monarch grows stronger. If sacrifice becomes glorified, the Martyr Monarch rises in power.
    
- **Cultural Influence**: Monarchs are not passive beings; they actively shape and manipulate societal beliefs to maintain or increase their power. Through subtle influence or outright domination, they ensure their continued reign. In order to ensure one monarch does not rise above another a system of **giving “authorities”** to beings of the spire rather than directly manipulating the world has been adopted, in hopes that said being **influences the world in the monarchs favor.**
