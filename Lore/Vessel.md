heavy w.i.p concept 

could rename vessels to vassals since vassals always work under kings “monarchs” i personally think vessels sounds better but vassals would play into our naming scheme

REPLACE every instance of capacity with affinity will be doing 

also no hard numbers better to keep it vague so more words like "high" or "low" or maybe "exceptional" vessel affinity 

the main characters would be people born with “100% vessel capacity” which would put them on the monarchs radar. good way to make the main characters different from npcs and explain away why some really devout followers of the sky monarch wouldn't have as much power as they would like

maybe the better vessel capacity a character has a closer connection they would have with the god???

vessel capacity could be random and also passed down so you could have a sort of “royal family's” with old world knowledge due to their long lasting ties with certain monarchs - also rulers in ancient china had a “mandate of heaven” which dictated them by god to be the ruler of china so that could play into the whole monarchs and literally monarchy's in the world

another idea i had was for the more vessel capacity (maybe affinity is a better word) the better your connection with a god could be so like 10% you kinda of feel god and at like 100 you can talk to your monarch (would play into why “the founder” was so aggressive in his expansion

we could take some inspiration from kaiju 8s system for how having affinity to the suits is kinda random but kinda genetic and you can kind of train to increase it decent idea imo
