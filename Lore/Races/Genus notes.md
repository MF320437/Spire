- **Environmental Resilience:** Genus have a natural resistance to harsh environments. Whether it's extreme heat, cold, or toxic conditions, they can endure and thrive where others might falter.
  
  **Education:** Learning is a lifelong pursuit for the Genus. They establish centers of knowledge where people of all ages can study and share their insights. Education is not just about preserving knowledge but about pushing boundaries and creating new understanding.
  
  preferably i would get rid of the resilience and lean their educational pursuit towards things that can help them survive and fight but idk im gonna have to wait to see if we bring back the other races
