- **Environmental Resilience:** Genus have a natural resistance to harsh environments. Whether it's extreme heat, cold, or toxic conditions, they can endure and thrive where others might falter.
  
  **Education:** Learning is a lifelong pursuit for the Genus. They establish centers of knowledge where people of all ages can study and share their insights. Education is not just about preserving knowledge but about pushing boundaries and creating new understanding.

2 keys notes
- i feel like environment resilience takes away from my core idea for the race. like the genus are not special because they can go somewhere cold and just adapt the genus are special because when they are somewhere cold they make coats and shit to not be cold
  - i feel like the education portion makes them a little too similar to the ashen. maybe we can angle this towards more "warlike" technology's like how china had the first gunpowder weapons but Europeans advanced them further far faster due to their constant wars needing better technology. this is still w.i.p
- "some say the genus bright eyes are a symbol of the bright future they see for them and their people" idk something cool i thought of maybe we could add to their description
