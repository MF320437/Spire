#Age
A Record of Forgotten Time

**Overview:**
The Age of Silence is a mysterious period in the history of [[Spire]], shrouded in secrecy and lost knowledge. This era began after Ignis, the Monarch of Rebirth, ignited the Flame of Life, an event that marked the end of the world as it was known and the beginning of a new, uncertain age. The Age of Silence is characterized by the emergence of new races, the disappearance of others, and the fractured memories of what came before. It is a time known only through fragmented records, whispered legends, and the enigmatic existence of the Ashen.

**The Flame of Life:**
The catalyst for the Age of Silence was the igniting of the Flame of Life by [[Ignis]]. This monumental event was intended to cleanse the world of its corruption and bring about a rebirth, but it also erased much of what had existed before. The Flame of Life consumed nearly everything, leaving behind only ashes from which new life would emerge. This rebirth was not without consequence, as it also severed the connection between the past and the present, plunging the world into a period of silence where knowledge and history were lost.

**The Emergence of New Races:**
As the ashes settled, new races began to rise from the remnants of the old world. These beings were fundamentally different from those who came before, shaped by the Flame of Life and the unknown forces that governed the Age of Silence. The [[Genus]], quick to adapt but lacking any memory of the past, were among the first to emerge. Their origins were a mystery even to themselves, and they began to carve out their own place in the world, separate from the more solemn and enigmatic [[Ashen]].

**The Isolation of the Ashen:**
The Ashen, reborn from the ashes and life force left by Ignis's final creation, retained fragmented memories of the past, but these memories were incomplete and often disturbing. They understood that something catastrophic had occurred, but not the full extent or the reasons behind it. This fractured knowledge led the Ashen to become increasingly isolationist, retreating from the new races and the world at large. They feared the authority of the Monarchs, believing that these powerful beings were somehow responsible for the downfall of the previous world. Their role as guides became one of caution and solemn reflection, as they sought to prevent a repeat of the tragedies they only half-remembered.

**Conflicts and Fears:**
The Age of Silence was not entirely peaceful. Conflicts arose between the Ashen and the newly emerged races, driven by fear, misunderstanding, and the Ashen's ominous aura. The Ashen's isolationism only deepened as these conflicts persisted, further alienating them from the rest of the world. The fear of Monarchs' authority grew among the Ashen, as their fragmented memories painted the Monarchs as the harbingers of destruction, though they could not recall the exact nature of the threat.

**Legacy of Silence:**
As the ages passed, the Age of Silence became a distant memory, its true nature forgotten by all but a few. The Ashen, with their fragmented knowledge, became the keepers of this lost era, but even they could not piece together the full story. The [[Genus]] and other races that emerged in the aftermath of the Flame of Life continued to thrive, unaware of the true origins of their world. The Age of Silence remained a period of mystery, a void in history that no one could fully comprehend, echoing through the ages as a reminder of the fragility of knowledge and the ever-present potential for rebirth and destruction.
