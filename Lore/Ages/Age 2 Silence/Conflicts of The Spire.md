#Age

my idea for the worlds lore would be to split it into old world and new world

“Age of fear” would be like BC prior to humans spreading throughout the earth where it was normalized for races or “tribes” (might think of a better term) to only worship few monarchs with little regard if they conflicted with values. which would make it difficult for certain less [“worshiped” monarchs to obtain vessels and cause strife with monarchs who opposed each other being worshiped by the same group.](https://trello.com/c/oSUFQvWB/21-power-dynamic)

 some massive set of events happen in world lore which lead to [[Genus]] creating the first “pantheon” or set of beliefs 
 
 im just gonna write key notes incase some more lore gets added which contradicts my general ideas for this age
 
 - "the founder" will be the key player in this age. as their [[Vessel]] affinity would probably make him top 5 strongest characters in the verse. (at least up until this point)
 - some massive set of events happen in world lore which lead to [[Genus]] creating the first “pantheon” or set of beliefs mainly revolving around the founder killing people and forcing people to convert or die
 - rough idea for the founder is that as a child he is either dying or being killed and this could cause ignis to take pity [[Ignis notes]] leading the founder to be granting with ignisus authority which would lead ignis to go on a journey attempting to consult "ancient guides" [[Ashen]] to understand what happened to him
 - the founder would learn of ignis and learn more about monarchs in general
 - i have 2 ideas for how this can play out
 - A the founder becomes infatuated with ignis leading him on a crusade to forcefully convert or kill mass populations of the land to created his holy empire for his new found faith
 - B the founder would see these powers as an opportunity to create an empire for [[Genus]] as historically they have faced extinction many times due to their general lack of advantage against other races of the spire.
 - after one of these 2 events unfold throughout his journeys he will face conflict from other people with monarchs authority's and possibly be granting another authority relating to how the [[Conflicts of The Spire]] play out which i the end would effect which monarchs his religion favors and ignores. 
 - i would like the most important battle in lore to be the founder facing off against a [[Kensai]] in a tobirama vs madara type battle where they possibly battle for days on end leading to the founder winning due to the kensai being old and out of his prime
 
 
 ignore below this is just so i dont forget some original ideas
 (maybe a particular genus with a unique capacity to embody many monarchs powers) is corrupted or convinced or just genuinely believes he should to take over as much land as possible for humans (a type of [genghis khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan), Julius Cesar or [Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne) type character) (as this would be beneficial for the monarchs embodying the human as it would lead to the spread of humans therefore giving them more followers) this will lead into a dispute with the monarchs themselves.
