#Age  
Monarchs POV during the “age of fear”  
  
seems like im gonna needs to rewrite this. will be able to keep a bit of it just gotta switch around a few names if marteenus lets me go along with my ignis notes. this will be a civil war between the monarchs on the basis of stopping or helping the founder create his new world / organized religion. [[1 Religions and Cults Overview]]

The conflict of the spire is going to cause a “civil war” between monarchs and i will be trying to make some type of relations chart thats unique and makes sense. For simplicity and since its not currently ironed out ima just put team ignis and team ???  
  
TEAM IGNIS                                                         TEAM ANTIGNIS  
Ignis                                                                        War + blood god concept “with war there is  
Mortis                                



MAIN REASON FOR CONFLICT  
War monarch believe that if the humans prevail in creating their “empire” there will be less future conflict / war. Ignis / death god teaming up in my mind makes sesne because the more people that are being killed in conflict (especially being burned alive by followers of ignis) will make people fear death far more and in hand clinging on to life or the power of “rebirth” from ignis a lot more. and generally people converting to following ignis to avoid death so i feel like they play into each other pretty well and increase each other's power.  

  
Any monarch in the category of ancient/unknown is in a dormant state due to something of this caliber not interesting them enough to do anything (might rework the lore for my [???](https://trello.com/c/pGU7hwfw/18-heavy-wip-might-scrap) race to have them created to end this conflict idk)  
  
rough idea is that war monarch will lose which will cause his followers to lose strength (which will play into how humans prevail overall) war god will be kinda op tho because its a literal war being fought in the “overworld” and wherever monarchs reside so once we get some more monarchs written someone on team ignis gotta die.  
  
the end goal is for there to be a religion of a few gods with death not being included but working with the monarchs of this religion but no one other then heads of this new church state would know maybe forcing them to cause conflicts in the modern era to appease death?**
