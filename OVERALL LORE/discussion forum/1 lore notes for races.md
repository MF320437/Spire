maybe we should make more "generic" descriptions of the races that you see when choosing a character (other than ashen) and the "real lore" of the races is something you learn through gameplay and exploring the map.


here would also be where we put the shit about the ashes - side not this could also explain why the world now has "monsters" and shit
