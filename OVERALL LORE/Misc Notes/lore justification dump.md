since the world's population would be a lot smaller idk if that would mean like 1 die hard follower is the same buff as like 20 modern day die hard followers

the game could take place at least like 200 years into “NW” new world era and i assume technology wouldn't get past matchlock rifles “or some type of fantasy equivalent if that exists.  
  
this story is similar to how the prophet Mohamed created islam and then after unifying the people under the Islamic religion and him as caliphate he set out to conquer outside the middle east

also this kinda ties into real world history how pre Christianity forms and Hellenism and gaullish paganism would kinda merge belief and there weren't strict guidelines for what it means to be hellenistic or worship these beings which could play into why monarchs wanted humans to take over and enforce a “stricter belief” as to it would make them more powerful and their enemy's weaker kinda like how it a lot of older religions or belief forms there wasn't necessarily “evil” concepts and every aspect of life was valued and Christianity would shun and proclaim this aspect of life IS BAD  
  
Ignis would see the founder as some way of regaining the prestige and love he once had from the people of the “spire”**
