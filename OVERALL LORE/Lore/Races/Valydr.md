**Children of the Wild)**

**The Valdyr** are territorial beasts born from the remnants of wild wolves and the life essence left after The Silence. These creatures took on a more humanoid form, as the combination of wolf and fallen human remnants gave rise to a fierce, pack-driven race. They are deeply connected to the wilderness and the untamed lands, with a primal need to protect their territory and bring pride to their kin. Among them, the legend of **Fafnir**, the strongest Valdyr believed to rival the gods, is passed down through generations. It is the life mission of every Valdyr to bring honor to their pack, following in Fafnir's footsteps.

**Nature and Disposition:**  
Valdyr are fierce and territorial, driven by loyalty to their pack and an ingrained sense of duty. They are bound by a strict code of honor where a Valdyr’s worth is measured by their deeds in battle and contributions to the pack. They are stoic and reserved, but their loyalty runs deep, especially when defending their own. A Valdyr will fight to the death if it means securing their territory or protecting their packmates. Their pride is immense, and dishonor to their pack is considered a stain that can only be cleansed through great deeds or exile.

### **Abilities:**

- **Predator’s Instinct:**  
    Valdyr gain an advantage when attacking weakened enemies. They deal additional damage to any enemy that has lost more than 50% of their health.
    
- **Pack Tactics:**  
    When adjacent to an ally, Valdyr gain increased accuracy and deal bonus damage, representing their ability to fight better when in groups.
    
- **Fafnir’s Resilience:**  
    Valdyr can endure significant damage. Once per battle, when their health drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 25%), they temporarily gain increased defense and are immune to crowd control effects for a turn.
    
- **Honed Senses:**  
    Valdyr have heightened senses of smell and hearing, allowing them to detect and avoid ambushes. In game terms, they have a higher chance of detecting hidden enemies or traps, and they gain increased dodge or resistance to surprise attacks.

### **Traits:**

- **Territorial Nature:**  
    Valdyr are fiercely protective of their territory. When fighting in familiar or "controlled" environments, they gain a defensive bonus or increased resistance to status effects.  
    _(In a turn-based system, this could be triggered when fighting in certain pre-determined areas or maps.)_
    
- **Pack Loyalty:**  
    Valdyr are driven by the need to protect their packmates. When an ally is attacked, they gain a temporary boost to their damage or a counterattack option for the next turn, signifying their desire to avenge or defend their comrades.
    
- **Honor-Bound:**  
    A Valdyr’s pride is at the core of their being. If they fall in battle, they take their attacker down with them. This trait could manifest as a final, retaliatory strike or a debuff applied to the enemy that lands the killing blow.

### **Society and Culture:**

- **Communities:** Valdyr live in tight-knit packs that function as both family and military units. These packs are organized hierarchically, with the strongest and most experienced Valdyr taking leadership as the Alpha. Each pack claims a specific territory, which they protect with fierce determination.
- **Rituals:** Valdyr culture revolves around strength and honor. They regularly hold combat trials and hunts to prove their prowess, and leadership positions can be challenged through ritualized combat. They also engage in territorial markings and ceremonies to honor fallen warriors and ancestors.
- **Fafnir's Legacy:** Every Valdyr is raised on the legend of Fafnir, the greatest Valdyr warrior. His deeds are chronicled in song and story, and his name is invoked before major hunts and battles. Valdyr strive to honor his memory by achieving great feats in his name.
- **Art and Expression:** Valdyr art takes the form of carvings and totems made from bones, wood, and stone, often depicting wolves, battles, and their ancestors. These are placed around their territory as symbols of protection and strength. They also practice war chants and songs passed down through generations to bolster morale before battle.
