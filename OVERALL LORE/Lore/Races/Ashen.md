#Race 
The Ashen are born from the remnants of the world after The Silence, emerging from the ashes and life force left by Ignis’s final creation. Their rebirth is marked by a unique and profound experience: upon their awakening, each Ashen perceives a fragment of the memories and emotions of the deceased from whom they were created. These fragments burned into their consciousness, shapes their nature and understanding of the world.

**Nature and Disposition:** The Ashen are characterized by their cold demeanor and lack of overt emotion. This is an in-direct result of the fragments of memory they carry from the deceased. Each Ashen perceives a strong emotion or concept—such as "Despair," "Hope," "Loss," or "Grief"—that deeply influences their nature. This fragment provides them with a limited understanding of the world before [[The Age Of Silence]] and imprints a solemn, reflective attitude upon them.
