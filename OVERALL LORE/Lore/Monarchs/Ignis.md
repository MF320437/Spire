**Origin Story***

**Early Life:**
Ignis, was a master blacksmith whose creations were renowned throughout [[Spire]] gifted with a divine spark from the [[Viviana]], Ignarius’s works held the power to heal, protect, and even extend life. However, as his fame grew, so did the desire of those who sought to use his creations for their own ends. Unbeknownst to Ignarius, the power infused in his creations began to warp the natural order, blurring the line between life and death.

**The Gift:**
Ignarius's fame attracted those desperate to escape death. One such individual, a powerful noble, obtained one of his artifacts and used it to raise an army of the dead. This abomination enraged  [[Mortis]], who viewed it as a violation of the natural order. As the dead walked the Spire and those who used Ignarius’s artifacts became cursed with eternal life, suffering endlessly, chaos engulfed the world. 

**The Downfall and the Birth of a Stigma:**
Witnessing the havoc unleashed by his creations, Ignarius was overwhelmed by guilt. The concept of rebirth, once a hopeful idea, became a source of terror. People began to fear not just death, but the possibility of being unnaturally resurrected. The stigma surrounding rebirth grew, and Ignarius became a figure of dread, his name cursed rather than praised.

Determined to right his wrongs, Ignarius retreated to his forge, where he spent years crafting one final creation: the [Heart of Rebirth]. This artifact was designed to cleanse the world of the chaos that had erupted, but at an unimaginable cost. Ignarius planned to unleash a great conflagration—a sea of flames that would incinerate the world, reducing everything to ash. From this destruction, a new world could rise, free from the corruption that had tainted it.

**Beginning Of The Period Of Silence:**
When Ignarius activated the [Heart of Rebirth], flames swept across [[Spire]], consuming all life in a cataclysmic event known as "The Silence." This was a period where every being except Ignarius was annihilated, their ashes serving as the foundation for the world's rebirth. [[Spire]] was left a barren wasteland, devoid of life, as the flames did their work. This will become known as [[The Age Of Silence]]


For a time, Ignarius wandered alone through the desolation he had created. In his final moments as a mortal, he cast himself into the flames, hoping to atone for the devastation he had caused. But instead of finding peace in death, Ignarius was transformed, ascending to become the Monarch of Rebirth. The stigma that surrounded rebirth had become so powerful that it gave rise to this new Monarch, binding Ignarius to the very force that had destroyed the world.

**Ascension to Monarch:** As the [[Monarch]] of Rebirth, Ignis wields the power of fire and renewal. His influence is both revered and feared, a force that can bring about new beginnings but only through the complete annihilation of the old. Ignis carries the weight of his past actions, not because the world remembers his mistakes, but because he does. His transformation was not a reward but a curse, forever tying him to the cycle of destruction and rebirth. The knowledge of what he unleashed on the world haunts him, making him a tragic figure.
