lowkey i rather his main goal just to be to kill himself to rid himself of his guilt would play into what i already have set for [[Conflicts of The Spire]] also i felt like the flame of life went harder than the Heart Of Rebirth "ignis ignited the Flame Of Life then the wold went to silence"
driven by the desire to ensure that the world never again faces such a catastrophe. 

maybe i have ignis see the founder as a child being burned alive for what ever reason will write later and ignis decided to spare him granting him his authority then the founder gains some type of extreme reverence and infautuation with ignis decided to bring on the events that unfold in [[Conflicts of The Spire]] and this kinda forces ignis to relive his trauma as someone who tried to spare people only for it to end up biting him in the ass again and the found will be the first time anyone has seen such an afinity for the monarchs authority in the long time blah blah blah the founder after reaching his full potential maybe fights with ignis and ignis is kinda demoralized and loses which leads to the founder becoming the new ignis and the story proceeding to th[[over]]
